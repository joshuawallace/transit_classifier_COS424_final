\section{Methods}

Our first approach to this problem will be to investigate the simple binary classifiers that we have covered in class so far. These include Naive Baye's, random forests, support vector machine (SVM), and logistic regression. With logistic regression will investigate two types of regularization using $l1$ and $l2$ penalties. We will also explore a set of feature selection methods such as mutual information.

Whilst our main goal is to predict which objects would be manually selected we are also interested in running a set of unsupervised learning algorithms to view any hidden structure in the data set. These methods will include Kmeans and gaussian mixture models. This will be useful for potentially identifying new approaches to automating this process as well as potentially probing some new relationships.
