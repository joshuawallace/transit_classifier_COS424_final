\section{Assessment Metrics}
We initially plan to use the metrics used in the first project to assess the accuracy of our classifiers. These include receiver operating characteristic  curves, recall and specificity statistics. Of particular interest, given the unbalanced data set, is to have a high true positive rate and a low false positive rate. Beyond this we will look at the specific features that are significant to understand what process is driving the selection.

For the unsupervised part of the project it will be much harder to assess our success. However it will be interesting to see if our methods are able to detect any physically meaningful categorizations.
