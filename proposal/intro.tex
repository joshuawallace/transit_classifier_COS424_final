Since the discovery of the first extra-solar planet (exoplanet) in the early 90's \cite{pulsarplanet}, nearly 3000 exoplanets have been discovered \cite{exoplanetorg}, with potentially thousands more exoplanets remaining unconfirmed or as yet undiscovered in existent data.  This explosion in exoplanet discovery has been fueled by the funding and construction of many exoplanet detection surveys.  The majority of exoplanets have been found by the space-based {\it Kepler} telescope and its primary and ``K2'' surveys \cite{kepler}, \cite{k2}.  Ground-based surveys, while not as sensitive to smaller planets as {\it Kepler} (due to atmospheric distortions and other problems associated with observing from the ground), are sufficiently sensitive to discover Jupiter-sized planets
