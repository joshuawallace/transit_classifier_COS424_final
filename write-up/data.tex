The data consists of ${\sim}$1000 examples of potential planet candidates that were decided, by eye, to be included as planet candidates, and ${\sim}$30,000 examples of potential planet candidates that were decided to not be regarded as planet candidates.  There are ${\sim}$90 features, all continuous, for each potential planet candidate.  These features include parameters and statistics related to the fitting of the brightness dips, parameters related to the measured planet size and orbital period, and properties of the host star (how bright it is in different colors, etc.).  The data were extracted from the proprietary HAT database using a script provided by Joel Hartman, Research Scienctist at Princeton University.  The database itself has not reference currently.
