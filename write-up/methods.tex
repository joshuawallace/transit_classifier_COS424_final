\subsection{Unsupervised Learning}
We used some unsupervised learning to see if any structure that arises in the models aligns well with the classification.  We use the K-means, principal component analysis (PCA), Gaussian mixture model (GMM), and latent Dirichlet allocation (LDA) algorithms from \texttt{scikit learn}\cite{scikit-learn}.  Data are scaled prior to the PCA analysis, and features are re-centered to avoid negative values for the LDA algorithm.  Clusters and cluster membership are examined to see if any clusters have predominately and most of the positive examples. We also use the PCA-transformed data in supervised learning models.
